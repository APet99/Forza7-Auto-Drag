<h3 align="center">Auto Drag Race To Earn Easy XP and CR</h3>

  <p align="center">
    An Automation tool to automatically start a drag race, compete, and do it all over again! This tool makes it easy to earn XP and CR in Forza Motorsports 7. This is <strong>not</strong> a cheat / hack / exploit. This tool simply automates the inputs as if you were doing it!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Note: For the best results, set the opposing Drivatar difficulty to unbeatable. 
    During development, an average of 970XP and 2,200CR was gained each run (30 sec). In an hour 116,400XP and 264,000CR can be earned!

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![proof2_img][proof2_img]

Forza 7 is a great time, but grinding XP and currency can be a drag (pun intended). I wanted to increase my rank and
money but I did not have the time to sit and race for long periods of time. As a result this tool was created. Little to
no programming knowledge is necessary.

So Why Build it?

* Not everyone knows how to read/write code.
* Grinding in Forza 7 can be a very time-consuming process!
* Repetitive tasks get really old. . . really quick. Automating the boring tasks of life will free up time, energy, and
  prevent headaches.

While this solution met my needs, you may find that features are missing or bugs hinder use of the script. If that is
the case, reach out and let's see what we can do :)

## Current Features

* Automatically Start and restart drag races
* Automatically launch with a very fast "response time". (Beat the opponent off the line)
* Automatically do it all again. ðŸ˜Š

### Built With

* [Python 3.8.X](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
